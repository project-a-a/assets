To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.","explorer":"https://bscscan.com/token/0xbf7c81fff98bbe61b40ed186e4afd6ddd01337fe","status":"active","links":[{"url":"https://twitter.com/ElrondNetwork","name":"twitter"},{"url":"https://elrond.com/blog/","name":"Blog"},{"url":"https://t.me/ElrondNetwork","name":"telegram"}]}
